MGX roles</A>
</H2>

<P>
MGX offers different access levels (roles), which are assigned individually for each
project: 
<BR>
<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Admins</SPAN> are equal to Users (see below), but can request access to be granted to additional users.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Users</SPAN> have full access to a MGX project and are able to define new or modify
present datasets, import new sequences and execute analysis jobs. They are also able to
delete all data associated with a project.
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Guests</SPAN> are provided read-only access to a project, i.e. they are able to access
all information already present, view analysis results and export data; however, they are
unable to perform new analysis or delete data from the project.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For all MGX projects, the person requesting the project is automatically added as an <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Admin</SPAN>.
As new users can always be added to an existing MGX project, all registered users are required
to carefully protect their login credentials and not to share them with any third party.
